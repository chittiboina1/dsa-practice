100-Day DSA Challenge

This repository contains my 100-Day Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice using Java and Python.

The goal is to systematically solve LeetCode, NeetCode, and FAANG-focused problems to prepare for software engineering interviews at top tech companies.

Each solution is written with clean, interview-ready code, including:

Problem description

Solution approach and key patterns

Time and space complexity analysis

This repo is intended for personal practice, revision, and sharing coding patterns for efficient problem-solving.
